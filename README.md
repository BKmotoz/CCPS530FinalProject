# CCPS530FinalProject
Final Project Files

For my CCPS 530 project, I built a basic website using HTML, javascript, and JQuery. This website was developed around the requirements outlined on the CCPS 530 Final Project marking rubric. This website was deployed on AWS and included the following elements:

Deployment: 
AWS

Database Connection:
Postgres 

Bootstrap:
colorpicker
image resizing

API's using JQuery
GifPlayer
http://rubentd.com/gifplayer/
Weather API
https://openweathermap.org/api

CSS and javascript paired with JQuery were used to format the website and add responsiveness.
